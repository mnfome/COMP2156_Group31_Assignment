DevOps
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that improve collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.
 It automates and integrates software development, testing, and deployment to deliver applications faster and more reliably. Key practices include CI/CD, monitoring, infrastructure as code (IaC), and collaboration tools.
